### Graph Description

The graph depicts the radial profile of an unspecified quantity, likely the **energy generation rate** or **density**, as a function of the logarithm of radius (in solar radii) for different stellar core masses (\( M_c = 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.35 \)). 
The x-axis represents the logarithm of radius, spanning from the core (\( \log(\text{Radius}) \approx 0 \)) outward, while the y-axis (in cgs units) shows the value of the plotted quantity. 
Each curve corresponds to a specific \( M_c \), with the sharp peak near the origin reflecting the central concentration of the quantity, likely in the stellar core.
The height of the peak increases with \( M_c \), indicating stronger activity or higher density in more massive cores. 
The smaller variations further out along the x-axis suggest additional structural features, possibly shell-burning regions, as the radius increases.
Overall, the graph highlights how the radial distribution of this physical quantity depends on core mass, with significant changes occurring as \( M_c \) increases.

### Energy Generation in Stars

Energy generation in stars is governed by nuclear fusion, primarily in the stellar core where temperatures and pressures are highest. 
Two main processes drive fusion: the proton-proton (PP) chain, which dominates in lower-mass stars, and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle, which dominates in stars with central temperatures exceeding \( 15 \times 10^6 \) K.
The CNO cycle is highly temperature-sensitive, with energy generation rates scaling roughly as \( T^{15-20} \). 
Given this, the graph likely represents the energy generation rate (in cgs units, such as erg/g/s) for stars dominated by the CNO cycle.
