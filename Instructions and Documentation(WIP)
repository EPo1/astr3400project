How to run

\
Clone repository to get tested mass files and profile data
  - git clone https://github.com/EPo1/astr3400project.git
  - Copy the #Mass_##M files to local directory to where you want path to be set

\
Access the evolve_both_stars MESA test suite
  - Show the files 
    - ls /opt/mesa/mesa-r23.05.1/binary/test_suite
- Copy the evolve_both_stars suite to your local machine
  - cp -r /opt/mesa/mesa-r23.05.1/binary/test_suite/evolve_both_stars ~/.
  - cd evolve_both_stars
- Get into file to change values 
  -type 'nano inlist_project' to get into file
-Under '&binary_controls' ONLY change M1 mass, will look like this:
  -  m1 = 1.0d0  ! donor mass in Msun                          
       m2 = 0.8d0 ! companion mass in Msun
-  To run the code 
    ./mk
    ./rn

- after the code is finished running for hopefully all 28 profile datas, take all the profiledata nd copy it over to a new file in the 
  evolve_both_stars called something like Mass_1M then run again using mass like m1=1.1d0 and repeat. After this then start the analysis
- also need to download the py_mesa_reader in the HOME. look at the last part of Lab 5 to do this

-Was looking into changing log output to somehow make then output into a new directory each time, but unable to find solution, currently it's set to a single path, and each new instance ovverrides the old profile data.
