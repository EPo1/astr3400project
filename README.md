# ASTR 3400 astrophysics coding project 2024

NEED TO DO NEXT:      

Put a *** at the front of the bullet point when you have completed it

- ***make graph of pp and cno chain against radius 
- ***figure out how to copy/download folders in Scorpius and send them to someone else
- *analysis of the graphs using graphs of pp and cno processes
- ***outline refinment and presentation completion
- try and make a graph of the mass against time (Can't be done)
- animation of the graphs
- why are there patterns inbetween elements in the big graph and why do the changes places for more mass accreted onto the star
- *why is there a peak in he3 for certain masses because of the pp chain
- there are also peaks in the cno chain and constituent elements for certain radiuses
- plot graphs again but for radius on the x axis instead of the y axis as this may reveal something that wasn't obvious before
- look at notes for astr3400 to see examples of project and bullet points of what we need in the outline and presentation
- look at the classes in MESA to see what to do next in order to next or to see if there is anything that may be useful in further explaining the data we have
- graph ratios of CNO and PP chain against each other
