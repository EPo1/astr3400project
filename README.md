# ASTR 3400 astrophysics coding project 2024

NEED TO DO NEXT:

- analysis of the graphs using graphs of pp and cno processes
- outline refinment and presentation completion
- try and make a graph of the mass against time
- animation of the graphs
- why is there a peak in he3 for certain masses because of the pp chain
- there are also peaks in the cno chain and constituent elements for certain radiuses
- plot graphs again but for radius on the x axis instead of the y axis as this may reveal something that wasn't obvious before
